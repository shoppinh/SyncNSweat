# Project Overview: "Sync & Sweat" (Example Name)

## 1. Concept

Sync & Sweat aims to be a personalized fitness companion that eliminates workout and music monotony. It will generate dynamic weekly gym schedules based on user goals and preferences, automatically rotating exercises each day. Seamlessly integrated with Spotify, it will also curate and rotate unique music playlists daily, ensuring every workout session is fresh, motivating, and tailored to the user.

## 2. Problem Solved

- **Workout Boredom**: Addresses the issue of repeating the same exercises, which can lead to plateaus and decreased motivation.
- **Music Fatigue**: Prevents users from getting tired of the same workout playlists.
- **Planning Overhead**: Simplifies the process of creating varied weekly workout schedules.
- **Discovery**: Helps users discover new exercises and music aligned with their tastes.

## 3. Target Audience

Individuals who frequent the gym or work out regularly, use Spotify for workout music, and desire variety, structure, and personalization in their fitness routine without extensive manual planning.

## 4. Core Features

1. **User Profiling & Goal Setting**: Collect user information like fitness goals (strength, endurance, weight loss, etc.), preferred workout days/duration, available equipment, target muscle groups, and music preferences (genres, artists, moods).

2. **AI-Powered Weekly Schedule Generation**: Based on user input, create a balanced and logical workout split for the week (e.g., Push/Pull/Legs, Upper/Lower, Full Body).

3. **Daily Exercise Rotation Engine**:
   - Maintain a database of exercises categorized by muscle group, equipment needed, type (strength, cardio, stretching), and difficulty.
   - For each scheduled workout day, select appropriate exercises from the database, ensuring they differ from recent sessions (e.g., previous day or week).
   - Prioritize exercises aligning with user preferences or areas they want to focus on.

4. **Spotify Playlist Integration & Rotation**:
   - Securely authenticate the user's Spotify account (using OAuth 2.0).
   - Access user's liked genres, artists, and potentially existing playlists.
   - Recommend and select a unique Spotify playlist for each workout day based on user preferences (genre, mood) or workout type (e.g., high-energy for cardio, focused for strength).
   - Ensure the chosen playlist differs from recent selections.

5. **Personalization Layer**: Initially recommend exercises/music based on explicit user preferences. Potentially add learning capabilities over time based on user feedback (e.g., skipping/liking exercises/songs).

6. **Workout View**: Display the daily workout with exercises (including instructions/GIFs/videos if available from the exercise source) and the selected Spotify playlist (with playback controls if feasible via Spotify SDKs, or deep-linking to the Spotify app).

## 5. Value Proposition

A smart, automated, and personalized workout planner that keeps fitness routines engaging and effective by combining dynamic exercise scheduling with fresh, motivating music from Spotify.

## 6. Summary Tech Stack Example (Python Backend + React Native Frontend)

- **Frontend**: React Native (TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **APIs**: Spotify Web API, ExerciseDB API (or similar)

## 7. Functional requirements
- Smooth Onboarding:
  - Use progress indicators during multi-step setup.
  - Clearly explain why information like equipment or goals is needed (personalization).
  - Allow skipping optional steps (like body metrics) to complete later.

- Clear Daily Workout View:
  - Visually distinct sections for exercises and music.
  - Easy-to-tap exercises for details.
  - Show estimated total workout time.

- Rich Exercise Information:
  - Visuals are Key: Include high-quality GIFs or short video loops for every exercise. Source these reliably from the exercise API or build your own library.
  - Concise, clear instructions.
  - Clearly list primary/secondary muscles worked and equipment needed.

- In-Workout Assistance:
  - Rest Timers: Built-in, configurable rest timers that automatically start after marking a set complete. Include sound/vibration alerts.
  - Exercise Swapping: Allow users to easily swap an exercise they can't or don't want to do with a suitable alternative (as per Flow 7). The logic should prioritize the same muscle group and user's available equipment.
  - (Optional) Weight/Rep Logging: Simple interface to log performance for progressive overload tracking. Auto-fill with previous data if available.

- Flexible Music Control:
  - Playlist Preview: Allow users to see a few tracks from the suggested playlist before committing/playing.
  - Easy Playlist Swapping: A clear "Refresh" or "Change Playlist" button if the user isn't feeling the vibe. Generate alternatives quickly based on preferences.
  - Seamless Spotify Handoff: Ensure deep-linking to the Spotify app is reliable and opens the correct playlist directly. If using embedded controls, ensure they are responsive.
  - Feedback Mechanism: Simple "like/dislike" option for playlists/genres to refine future music recommendations over time.

- Adaptive Scheduling & Personalization:
  - Schedule Regeneration: Offer to regenerate the schedule if user profile changes significantly (e.g., new equipment, changed goals, different available days).
  - Feedback Loop: Allow users to rate workouts or exercises (simple thumbs up/down) to help the algorithm learn preferences beyond swaps.
  - Intensity Adjustment: Potentially allow users to specify if they want a lighter or more intense workout on a given day, adjusting sets/reps or exercise difficulty accordingly.

- Progress Tracking & Motivation:
  - Workout History: Simple calendar or list view of completed workouts.
  - (Optional) Gamification: Streaks for consecutive workouts, badges for milestones (e.g., "Completed 10 Workouts", "Tried 5 New Exercises").
  - (Optional) Basic Analytics: Simple charts showing workout frequency, maybe progress on logged lifts if that feature is implemented.

- Notifications & Reminders:
  - Opt-in reminders for scheduled workout days.
  - Notifications should be timely and not overly intrusive.

- Offline Capability:
  - Cache the current week's schedule and exercise details (including instructions/GIFs) for offline access once generated. Music obviously requires connectivity.

- Performance & Clarity:
  - Fast loading times, especially for the daily workout view and exercise details.
  - Intuitive navigation, minimal taps to get to core functions.
  - Clean, uncluttered UI design.
